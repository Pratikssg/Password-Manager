# Password-Manager
This is a fully functional GUI Password Manager in Python that allows you to effectively store your website name, username, and passwords as a JSON file. While creating this GUI Tkinter, random, and pip modules have been used. In this, all the website names, usernames, and passwords are stored locally as a JSON file.
